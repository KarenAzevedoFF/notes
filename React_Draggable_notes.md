# React Draggable

Library: https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable

## Pros

Decent examples

Decent tutorial

Good documentation

Flexible

There are 2 Draggable Component types. The Draggable that manages its own state and the Draggable Core Component. It has no internal state. This is useful as an abstraction over touch and mouse events but with full control

It's super customizable.

I believe that It will save us a lot of work
